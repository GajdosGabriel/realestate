                <p class="text-center">HIGH NET WORTH INVESTOR STATEMENT</p>

                <p>I make this statement so that I can receive promotional communications which are exempt from the restriction on promotion of non-mainstream pooled investments. The exemption relates to certified high net worth investors and I declare that I qualify as such because at least one of the following applies to me:</p>

                <p>I had, throughout the financial year immediately preceding the date below, an annual income to the value of £100,000 or more. Annual income for these purposes does not include money withdrawn from my pension savings (except where the withdrawals are used directly for income in retirement).</p>

                <p>I held, throughout the financial year immediately preceding the date below, net assets to the value of £250,000 or more. Net assets for these purposes do not include:</p>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li>(a) the property which is my primary residence or any money raised through a loan secured on that property; or</li>

                    <li>(b) any rights of mine under a qualifying contract of insurance; or</li>

                    <li>(c) any benefits (in the form of pensions or otherwise) which are payable on the termination of my service or on my death or retirement and to which I am (or my dependants are), or may be, entitled; or</li>

                    <li>(d) any withdrawals from my pension savings (except where the withdrawals are used directly for income in retirement).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I accept that the investments to which the promotions will relate may expose me to a significant risk of losing all of the money or other property invested. I am aware that it is open to me to seek advice from an authorised person who specialises in advising on non-mainstream pooled investments.</p>
