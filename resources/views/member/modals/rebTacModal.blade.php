                <h3 class="text-center lang xs-mt-20">Purpose of the bond</h3>

                <ol class="lang">
                    <li>The bond is to finance Issuer's short-term and long-term real estate projects, in particular the already selected real estate as well as the construction or renovation of the selected real estate. The Issuer shall also use the bonds to acquire the real estate portfolio.</li>

                    <li>The Issuer declares that the funds of each bondholder under these Terms will be entrusted to a subsidiary specially established and owned by the Issuer (100% of shares). This subsidiary will independently invest in the selected real estate projects of the Issuer. In this way, the Issuer will ensure that the bondholder's finances are transparent and separated from the finances of other bondholders under these Terms.</li>

                    <li>The selected real estate project of the Issuer's subsidiary will be financed not only through the bonds but also through a loan granted by a bank for a particular real estate project of the Issuer's subsidiary. In this way, the Issuer, through its subsidiary, secures a transparent and advantageous financing for the real estate project, thereby increasing the profitability of the real estate project and guaranteeing sustainable bond yields under these Terms.</li>

                    <li>The Issuer declares that the funds provided through the bonds issued under these Terms will be invested in real estate projects within the European Union, in particular the Central Europe region, and/ or in the related business activities of the Issuer including marketing or promotion activities. The activities under the preceding sentence shall be carried out only through Issuer’s subsidiaries.</li>

                    <li>The Issuer declares that it will invest through its subsidiaries only in real estate projects that show signs of full and quick return on investment. The Issuer has exclusive competence to determine its investment policy regarding its real estate projects.</li>

                    <li>The Issuer reserves the right to use finances from the bonds for other purposes as well, in particular to cover its own operating expenses necessary for its business activities or marketing activities related to the real estate projects in question.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="text-center lang">Yield determination method</h3>

                <p class="lang">The yield is determined by a fixed interest rate (yield) of 8% p.a. of the bond’s nominal value (face value) for each year (or part thereof) till the maturity date. The yield is paid to the bondholder and is calculated for the period from the date the bond was issued to the bondholder in the paper note until the maturity of the bond. The yield is calculated as follows: actual number of days of bond ownership / 365. The interest period is the period commencing on the date of bond issue until the maturity.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center lang">Method of payment</h3>

                <p class="lang">The Issuer undertakes to pay up the interest on the bond on the maturity date by wire transfer to the bank account of the bondholder. The bondholder should provide the Issuer with the bond in question for inspection 3 (three) business days prior to the maturity date; at the same time, the bondholder shall notify the Issuer in writing of the account number to which the yield is to be paid if he requests the interest to be paid to another account number than the bondholder has indicated in the bond purchase agreement.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center lang">Maturity date of the nominal value (face value)</h3>

                <p class="lang">The nominal value (face value) of the bond will be redeemed on a one-off basis within 24 months of the bond issue date. At the date of the face value repayment the bond ceases to bear interest.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center lang">Issuer’s statement</h3>

                <p class="lang">The Issuer declares that it owes the nominal value (face value) of the bonds to the bondholders and, at the same time, undertakes to repay the nominal value (face value) of the bonds and to pay the yield under these Terms.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center lang">Warnings for the bondholder</h3>

                <ol class="lang">
                    <li>In accordance with the stated purpose of using the funds for which the bonds were issued under these Termss, the Issuer advises and warns future bondholders that real estate investments (purchase / sale), real estate projects (construction / renovation) are generally the activities connected with certain risks, in particular the risks associated with constantly changing local, national and international economic conditions; supply and demand for real estate; the financial capacity of tenants, buyers and sellers; changes in interest rates; changes in environmental regulations; changes in legal regulations in the field of construction planning; and other public interventions as well as changes in fiscal and monetary policy; changes in legal, regulatory and tax environment; changes in real estate tax rates; legal defects regarding real estate; negative economic changes coupled with a decline in tourism and a drop in retail sales; unforeseen losses; the effects of force majeure; terrorist incidents; losses not covered by insurance policy or events that are insurable; and other factors that could not be averted even when exercising due diligence.</li>

                    <li>In addition to the above risks, the bondholder should note that the value of real estate is subject to long-term cyclical trends that cause considerable price volatility. Concentrated real estate investments and real estate-backed investments are exposed to the above specified risk, as such investment is not considered a collective investment under specific legislation.</li>

                    <li>Investing in real estate is due to the concentration in this specific sector (or in a geographical location) exposed to a higher market risk. Real estate investments may be subject, in particular, to the risks of falling real estate prices, risks associated with the general and economic market conditions, changes in the value of real estate that are subject to real estate investments and non-repayment of loans. The value of your investment and your earnings may fluctuate and your investment or yield thereof is not guaranteed.</li>

                    <li>The bondholder should note that the previous profits of the Issuer are not a guarantee of future earnings, and also that foreign investment is subject to the specific risks of the foreign currency, as well as political and economic risks. Exchange rates may cause the value of the underlying foreign investment to fall or rise.</li>

                    <li>Investments in emerging markets may be more volatile due to the macroeconomic or political situation than those in other markets, which poses an increased risk to the capital invested by the bondholder, and therefore the aforementioned facts may affect the true value of the bond.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="text-center lang">Bond issue method</h3>

                <p class="lang">Bonds will be issued on the basis of an offer without prior publication of an approved prospectus in accordance with Art. 120, par. 1 and par. 3 c of the Act on Securities. Bonds are intended for a limited number of people, maximum of 149 persons who will be issued the bonds after the bonds have been ordered from the Issuer. The Issuer has not set a minimum amount for the success of the bond issue. The bondholder shall be issued a bond within 3 (three) business days of the day the bond purchase price was credited to the Issuer's account. The bond is to be sent via post to the address of the bondholder. The posting date of the bond is considered the date of issue of the bond to the bondholder.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center lang">Transfer of bonds</h3>

                <p class="lang">Bonds may be transferred only with the prior consent of the Issuer. The bondholder is entitled to transfer the bond only with the prior written consent of the Issuer. Otherwise, such a transfer is deemed invalid. The previous bondholder is obliged to notify the Issuer in writing of the transfer of the bond to which the Issuer has agreed not later than 3 days after the date of such transfer.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center lang">Marketability</h3>

                <p class="lang">No application for admission of bonds to trading on a regulated market will be filed.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center lang">A method of securing funds for the payment of bonds</h3>
