                <p>The director believes that an investment in Bonds may be subject to a number of risks. Prospective investors should consider carefully all of the information set out in this risk disclosure and the risks attaching to an investment in the Company, in particular the risks described below, before making any investment decisions. If any of the following risks relating to the Company were to materialize, the Company’s business, financial condition and result of future operations could be materially adversely affected.</p>

                <p>1.1. Additional risks and uncertainty that are not presently known to the director, or which the director currently deem immaterial, may also have an adverse effect upon the Company. Moreover, the list below may not be exhaustive.</p>

                <p>1.2. Prospective investors should consider carefully whether investment in the Bonds is suitable for them in the light of information in this Invitation page and their personal circumstances.</p>

                <p>1.3. The client is aware that this product is not an investment product or structured product offered by the depositary bank.</p>

                <p>1.4. Attention! You invest outside the supervision of the Slovak security commission and National Bank. No obligation of a prospectus for this activity.</p>

                <h3>2. Risks specific to investing in micro-cap companies</h3>

                <p>2.1. Material contracts between the Companies and other entities CEE’s core business and activities, through its associated asset manager, are to do business in, the main, making and managing of equity finance, asset, property and project finance. This is largely corporate and asset finance and participation in both speculative and non-speculative, long term strategic associations, including value added products and assets that CEE is capable of funding. The legal arrangements to put these financings in place may vary depending on a number of factors including the nature and features of the financing process and the sums undertaken by CEE and other entities in related transactions. We believe the Company and the legal advisors have provided the most effective protection to the Company acting as a lender.</p>

                <p>2.2. Operational Risk CEE, its affiliates and subsidiaries (if any from time-to time) are exposed to operational risk. Operational risk is the risk of losses that may arise as a result of system inefficiencies, breakdowns in internal processes, human error or the effect of any external negative factor. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to prevent operational risks materializing, or mitigate the damage caused should such operational risks materialize.</p>

                <p>2.3. Financing Risk CEE’s core business and activities is, but not limited to, making and managing of equity finance, asset, property and project finance. Although financings are typically secured by related parties involved in the relevant transactions, there can be no absolute assurance that upon a default, the Company can recover the amount of the financing in default.</p>

                <p>2.4. Liquidity Risk Typically, investments into private equity and unlisted public companies are subject to limits in the levels of liquidity which may impact the ability of the company to exit their investments within the desired time frames. The Company’s director, officers and advisors do all they can to identify and plan for liquidity. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to plan for and mitigate the damage caused should it find itself in circumstances of liquidity stress or shortfalls. The foregoing factors are not exhaustive and do not purport to be a complete explanation of all the risks and significant considerations involved in investing in the CEE Real Estate Bond. Accordingly, and as noted above, additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the director, or that the director currently deem immaterial, may also have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and prospects.</p>
