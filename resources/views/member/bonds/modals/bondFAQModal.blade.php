                <h3>What happens after 3, 5 or 7 years?</h3>

                <p>Buyers retain full investment back. They can choose to sell it, renegotiate terms with CEE Levante Group or
                    replace them for new CEE Bonds.</p>

                <h3>Why is it better to have a longer fixed income term?</h3>

                <p>Unlike shorter income periods, CEE Levante Group cannot artificially inflate the purchase price to cover the
                    outlay of returns. A longer-year fixed income period is evidence that CEE is paying a competitive price for
                    the property, and there for the longer period the higher the yearly interest rate CEE can give to their bond
                    holders.</p>

                <h3>What tax am I responsible for?</h3>

                <p>Buyers of the bond are responsible for annual income tax payments, with the exact amount dependent on your own
                    country tax rules and regulations.</p>

                <h3>What costs do I have to pay during the fixed income period?</h3>

                <p>None whatsoever.</p>

                <h3>What is my relationship with CEE Real Estate Group?</h3>

                <p>A 3, 5 or 7-year fixed income period is evidence that your interests are the same as CEE Real Estate Group’,
                    who are ultimately responsible for the delivery of yields. CEE work to ensure the property’s profitability
                    from purchase through the rental income and to the resale.</p>

                <h3>How do I know CEE manage the property effectively?</h3>

                <p>The interests of CEE Real Estate Group are the same as yours; CEE is incentivized to ensure 100% occupancy and
                    to nurture rental growth for the Bond holders and themselves.</p>

                <h3>What experience do CEE Real Estate Group have?</h3>

                    triangle region and are responsible for the collection of many millions in rent from a property portfolio. CEE
                    is also recognized by many know companies in this region.</p>

                <h3>Who manages the property?</h3>

                    this on their behalf to get the highest occupancy and short-term rental income (like AirBNB and Booking.com).
