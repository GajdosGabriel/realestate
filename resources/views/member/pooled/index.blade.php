        <p>CEE Real Estate Group investment firm may offer investors the opportunity to join in pooled financial resources. Choosing to participate in a firmâ€™s joint funds can give investors access to investments that would be beyond their means individually. An investor might obtain fractional ownership in a luxury apartment tower, for instance.</p>

        <p>Even without participating in a joint fund, an investor might become the co-owner of a property or have several units within a property, yet still benefit from the management provided by the firm. Often investors benefit from shared liabilities too, with individual holdings included in a joint fund to guarantee income in the event of vacancies, and umbrella insurance coverage provided by the firm.</p>
